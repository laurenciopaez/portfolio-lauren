## About Me

Hello! My name is Laurencio Paez, and I'm from Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires. I studied Full Stack Web Development at Henry and have been pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering since 2017. Recently, I started studying Computer Engineering. My engineering background has equipped me with knowledge in applied physics, metallurgy, algorithms, applied mathematics, and administration.

I consider myself a person with strength, determination, and persistence to solve problems. I've also developed essential teamwork skills, including collaboration, communication, and conflict resolution. These soft skills have been cultivated in both my education at Henry and throughout my engineering career.

In addition to my engineering skills, I have experience in web development using languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm familiar with tools like React.js and Node.js. Currently, I'm seeking an opportunity to complete my engineering studies while contributing as a developer with logical-mathematical thinking and significant growth potential.
